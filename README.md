# Workshop on Machine Learning Assisted by Mechanistic Modeling for Estimating Subsurface Soil Texture and Organic Carbon Content

Description:
The Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) invites you to a workshop focused on developing a machine learning model to estimate subsurface soil texture and soil organic carbon content at high spatial resolution using satellite images.

Outcomes:
Participants will gain the ability to determine subsurface soil characteristics in a specific field using a limited dataset – an approach accessible to farmers and researchers alike.

Data & Tools:
•	Data: Sentinel-2 L2A satellite images, digital elevation models, and soil profile data from 12 field points.
•	Required Materials: Computer, Python (with relevant libraries), MONICA model, and provided data files.

Event Details:
•	Date: July 25th, 2025.
•	Location: ZALF, Hause 45, Eberswalde Str. 84, 15374 Müncheberg.
•	Fee: 10.00 €
•	URL for registration: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUC9BjJixLCMKIvy_qlbRHyx92A0lSA55XF-YGdj9gRxrioQ/viewform?usp=dialog
